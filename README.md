Make your way through 5 levels in the fast-paced 2D platformer, using your movement abilities to get through the levels as fast as you can, without getting hit!. You can grapple enemies to stun them, pulling them towards you and slowing down time, for the perfect accurate hit! Theres also spotlights around the levels that you can grapple to, for even more mobility and versatility. There are breakable surfaces you can grapple to and destroy to access more areas as well.
